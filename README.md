======================================

Websites are becoming increasingly heavy and complex over the years. They represent an important part
of the digital environmental footprint. The objective of this project is to detect smells in a website source code
that can have a negative ecological impact: overconsumption of energy, "fatware", shortening of the life span of
devices, etc. This project is part of [ecoCode](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode).

Rules in this repository are mainly based from book
[115 Web Ecodesign Best Practices](https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices).
This reference is maintained by [CNumR](https://collectif.greenit.fr/), a french collective that works
for a responsible design of digital services. You can find all applicable rules in
the [main ecoCode repository](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode/tree/main/docs/rules).

> ⚠️ These plugins are in a very early stage and need improvements. Any contribution will be appreciated.
