## Hello! We are pleased to see you here üëã

Please read
common [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in `ecoCode-common` repository first.\
Also check the [starter pack](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md) to
have the basic information before starting.

## Structure

The JavaScript plugin is divided into 2 modules:

- `eslint-plugin` contains the ESLint plugin part
- `sonar-plugin` contains the SonarQube plugin implementation

The ESLint plugin **can be standalone** and is packed inside SonarQube plugin during the build phase.

## Requirements

### For the SonarQube plugin

- Java JDK 11+
- Maven 3.8 or later

SonarQube provides a documentation to
learn [plugin basics](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extension-guide/developing-a-plugin/plugin-basics/).

### For the ESLint plugin

- Node.js 14.17.x, 16.x, 18.x or newer
- Yarn 2+ ([installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- ESLint plugin maintenance skills
- ESLint custom rule creation skills

The ESLint documentation is very detailed and provides a useful starting point.\
Check more here: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules

It is possible to write and test the rules directly in this project which provides unit tests.\
But it can be useful to prepare a test project to check the correct execution of the rules.

## Installation

1. Clone the Git repository
2. Run `yarn install` inside **eslint-plugin** directory
3. You are good to go! üöÄ

## Create a rule

### In the ESLint plugin

The file structure inside **eslint-plugin** package provides an ESLint-compliant project.\
So, the rule creation follows the recommended standards.

> It may be useful to take a look at rules already written to use the same structure and conventions.\
> Also please provide license header inside files with source code (there is an example inside file `lib/rule-list.js`).

Example set of files to add a rule called **"my-awesome-rule"**:

- `lib/rules/my-awesome-rule.js`: main file with the rule metadata and algorithm
- `docs/rules/my-awesome-rule.md`: documentation file written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
  to explain the rule
- `tests/lib/rules/my-awesome-rule.js`: testing file written
  using [ESLint RuleTester](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/integrate/nodejs-api#ruletester)

The project itself uses ESLint to helps linting rule algorithms.

### In the SonarQube plugin

The SonarQube plugin does not contain the implementation of rules, only declarations and documentations.

Example set of files to add a rule called **"my-awesome-rule"** (SonarQube key: **EC1**):

- `src/main/java/io/ecocode/javascript/checks/MyAwesomeRule.java`: declaration file with the SonarQube key and the
  ESLint key
- `src/main/resources/rules/javascript/EC1.json`: detail of the rule for SonarQube
- `src/main/resources/rules/javascript/EC1.html`: documentation of the rule for SonarQube

You will also need to edit custom profile JSON file and `CheckList.java` to add your rule name in appropriate lists.

### Test the rule

Rule tests also follow the ESLint standards and
use [ESLint RuleTester](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/integrate/nodejs-api#ruletester).\
They are executed with the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework.

Please add as many valid and invalid uses cases as necessary for a each rule.\
This will allow a large code coverage and avoid false positives.

Run the following script to start all test suites: `yarn run test`.\
To display tests coverage, use `yarn run test:cov`.

### Generate rule documentation

A tool called [eslint-doc-generator](https://github.com/bmish/eslint-doc-generator) is used in the project to update
documentation of rules.\
It allows to update rule doc file and main README based on metadata of rules.

Two npm scripts are available:

- `yarn run update:eslint-docs` to update Markdown files with data of rules
- `yarn run lint:eslint-docs` to verify auto-updated data of rules in Markdown files

All the generated code is between commented lines with "auto-generated" in the text.\
**Please run update script** after a rule creation.

## End of development?

The last step is to open a PR on this project with the implementation of the rule, and a second one on the test
project with an exemple of a code not following rule needs. Keep an eye on the coverage of your rule implementation üëÄ

This is the end of this guide, thank you for reading this far and contributing to the project üôè.
